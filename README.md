### The All-In-One VGC Draft League Software Suite for macOS.

**Rotom Draft** is a suite of software tools to help **VGC Draft League** players bring their best game to their matches. 
Powerful integrations with [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), the PokeAPI, and PokePast.es let you quickly design the optimal strategy for your next match.

Features:

Rotom Draft features three main areas: the Analysis pane, the Tool drawers, and the Damage Calculator. 

The Tool drawers features powerful applets that let you do things like: build your roster, calculate optimal tera-types, keep track of the league's schedule and standings, keep notes or records for each match, and build teams based on the Pokémon on your roster. 

The Analysis pane is where you go to deep dive into a roster's moves, stats, type matchups, battle strategies, speed control methods, and the like. You can also keep track of your league's draft board here to plan trades and swaps. 

Finally, the Battle Calculator lets you quickly make critical calcs between Pokemon on different teams and rosters, saving tweaks, as needed. It's a fully-embedded version of the Pokémon Showdown calculator, so all the results and interactions are identical to what you would calculate online. 

Organizing Principles

The basic organizing principle behind Rotom Draft is that groups of Pokémon are organized hierarchically like this: League => Roster => Team.

A League is the whole event. Essentially, a tournament. Leagues have rulesets associated with them that control what's available on the Draft Board. Each league also features its own schedule, leaderboard, and playoff bracket. If you're in several draft Leagues at one time, Rotom Draft helps you keep those different Leagues sequestered, so you're never confused as to which League your looking at.

A Roster is a coach's selection of Pokémon, usually 10 in standard VGC formats. Rosters can be associated with a league. Multiple rosters typically belong to a single league. Most of Rotom Draft's analysis functions apply to entire Rosters so you can see the plethora of interactions and counter-interactions that a player can create using 10 (or any number of) Pokémon. Rosters can be imported or exported via PokePast.es, so you can easily import (and backup) existing Showdown data.

Teams are the final party of six Pokémon a player brings to a match. Teams are typically composed of a subset of the Pokémon in a Roster. They can be customized and tweaked just like on Showdown, with Abilities, Movesets, Natures, Items, and more. They can be imported or exported to/from Showdown for backing up or testing. Teams are what you load into the Battle Calculator and can feature more than 6 Pokémon, e.g., if you need to calc your team against an opponent's entire roster.
